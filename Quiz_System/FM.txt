Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; September 5, 1946 – November 24, 1991) was a British singer-songwriter best known for being the main vocalist of the rock band Queen. He was recognized for his flamboyant stage demeanor and four-octave vocal range, and was regarded as one of the best singers in the history of rock music. Mercury disregarded rock frontman traditions with his theatrical manner, which influenced Queen's aesthetic direction.

Mercury was born in 1946 in Zanzibar to Parsi-Indian parents. From the age of eight, he attended English-style boarding schools in India before returning to Zanzibar for secondary school. His family left the Zanzibar Revolution in 1964 and relocated to Middlesex, England. He formed Queen with guitarist Brian May in 1970 after years of studying and writing music.Roger Taylor, the drummer, and May. "Killer Queen," "Bohemian Rhapsody," "Somebody to Love," "We Are the Champions," "Don't Stop Me Now," and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" are just a few of Mercury's Queen classics. As seen at the 1985 Live Aid concert, his energetic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience. He also had a solo career and worked as a producer and sideman for other musicians.
