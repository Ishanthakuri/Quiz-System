John Winston Ono Lennon (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940 â€“ 8 December 1980) was an English singer, songwriter, musician, and peace activist who rose to international prominence as the Beatles' founder, co-composer, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist. In his music, writing, and paintings, as well as on film and in interviews, Lennon was known for his rebellious attitude and biting humor. His songwriting collaboration with Paul McCartney is still one of the most successful in history.

As a teenager, Lennon became embroiled in the skiffle craze in Liverpool. He established the Quarrymen in 1956, which later became the Beatles in 1960. He was known as "the intellectual Beatle" and served as the group's de facto leader until McCartney took over. In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, two collections of nonsense writings and line drawings, were published by John Lennon in the mid-1960s. His songs were taken as anthems by the anti-war movement and the greater counterculture, beginning with "All You Need Is Love." In 1969, Lennon formed the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, multimedia artist Yoko Ono, and staged the two-week-long anti-war protest Bed-Ins for Peace before leaving the Beatles to pursue a solo career.
